<p>I have spent most of my life trying to curate something I will call a <em>rotation</em>. This concept comes from the games I played as a child. In these games you were wizards and warriors, rogues and witch doctors, Knights and Healers. Each one of these had a set of tools that was good for handling different situations. They complimented and countered each other.</p>
<p>As you played the game, you would collect different spells, attacks, and support skills. These skills were effectively tools on your tool belt. You would collect these tools, learn how to use them, curate them so you had exactly what you needed to deal with any situation as best as you can. You would study your strengths and weaknesses so you could play well as a team. Create <em>compositions</em> with others.</p>
<p>The tools on your belt along with how you would use them in different situations was called a rotation. You could have different rotations for different kinds of fights, and you might move a skill or tool in or out of your rotation depending on how it is performing. Sometimes how one tool performs depends on how well it performs in concert with other tools. This is called a <em>synergy</em>.</p>
