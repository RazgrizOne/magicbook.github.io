If when conquering America, we only had guns and men we would have had serious trouble. In actuality we had plagues brought over to the Americas and other places. This was the equivalent of having a nuclear bomb when we were still using wooden ships. Actually stronger than a nuclear bomb We had warfare technology from 100’s of years in the future.  As time has went on, there has been long term trends of these shifting to what I identify as the state of the game today.\n The limitation of resources is starting to be felt resource limitations will eventually be set by our ability to increase resource use efficiency and increase re usability. pollution is now global. The technological revolution required to solve this issue is massive and cannot be seen on the horizon yet. social circles have ballooned to sizes that cannot be handled by individuals. computer power has focused to the top through wealth inequality. The few have never been so capable of controlling the populace as a whole. With the data collected on individuals and robotic weaponry, the general populace will have no ability to disagree with policies created by those in power.  Artificial Intelligence as an extension of evolution and probably the only solution, and cause to our future problems. A lot of this is not new. Those in power have always had this sort of power, but it is a different flavor than it has been in the past. Just as people could only write books by hand long ago, now printing presses can crank out enough books for everyone in the world in a short time, and now, you don’t even need a book.\nTechnology for violence is only held back by the ability for people to identify an action as violent. If someone dies of ‘natural causes’ there is no violence done, and no one to be targeted for retribution. Just as, if someone is removed from a position of power through social engineering, there is no one to blame but the group as a whole. This blame of the group is largely false. It is obvious there is social manipulation at play, but it is not one person controlling it all, but many people all vying for their own interest in a complex game that creates this\nOur ability to identify the many causes and affects that create the larger waves that we call society, government, religion, etc are limited. A human cannot hold all of the variables in their mind simultaneously and so they cannot solve problems when they arise through the normal means by which one would solve a problem.\nIn a simple problem, you can see all the variables, and you can come to a conclusion by understanding each in its entirety and then making the perfect decision to solve the problem. In complex systems, this no longer works. The amount of variables and interactions are effectively infinite, and so the only way to solve the problem is to use advanced statistics applied to as many ‘important’ variables as you can find, and then use evolutionary algorithms to move towards the correct answer.\nIn my mind, to have an evolutionary algorithm you need two things. A method for creating an equation, a method for randomizing that equation, and a method for determining the efficacy of the solution given by the evolutionary algorithm. Games are the battleground for proving this system works. This is why the first proving grounds for AI were in video games. With a binary win lose condition and scoring systems, they easily allow for determining the usefulness of an algorithm.\nYou can think of reality as a infinite dimensional array with infinite variables and infinite connections between each variable, but with different weights between each.\nAn example:\na one dimensional array is a set of numbers. This string of characters you are reading is a one dimensional array. A 2 dimensional array could be a picture, a set of color values for pixels on a screen. 3d is how we think of space, but it need not be the reality of space, only how our brain processes it given the type of camera (our eyes) that we view the world through. What does 4 dimensions look like? Well, when I talked about 2d, I did not give an image, I gave a concept. A string of characters that is then translated into words on a screen that you read, but the underlying characters are sets of 1’s and 0’s or on and off switches. Binary. So 4d could be every point in 3d space along with a value for energy occupying that space…. and 5d could be every point in space with a distance value from every other object in space etc. This can go on forever because in a theoretical sense, every point in space has infinite information to know about it when taken in context with all of space. At least as far as we know.\nTo know what will happen with some accuracy you do not need to know every single input in reality, because statistics is here to save the day. Because the weights of importance of each input are not equal, and because strong inputs can usually be observed in some way, it is possible to guess at an outcome based on limited information. But you can do one better. You can guess at the mathematical model that will predict the outcome by randomly altering a generalized algorithm using what is known about statistics and calculus (along with a lot of other fancy math) and get a close enough approximation to be useful. In the confines of video games where all variables are known, this method destroys the best human players in existence. As more ‘games’ become computerized, and we stack further advances with this technique, they will do far better than us in almost all information gathering tasks. At some point the difference between human and computer will not exist. We will be the computer. This mathematical model essentially attempts to emulate existence, to brute force the answers to the question that is reality. This will be the ‘game’ that people play, and it is not science fiction. It already exists, and you can see it at work right now, though a bit rudimentary.\nInformation warfare is not new It is no coincidence that religious groups get buddy buddy with news and politics. If you want to control people you change their ideas. This is why books are burned. This is why news is flooded with bullshit. Propaganda is all around us, everything you find in front of your face has a goal to make you feel or act a certain way. Disney got its start as war propaganda. Video games to make you put coins in the machine, and now to open loot boxes. You can only trust statistics. Sad truth, but the good news is that it means that truth is a solvable equation. Partially, the limit is that solving this equation takes actual energy and time as addressed later.\nComputer infrastructure as real infrastructure One of the mistakes people make is believing that thought is an unlimited resource that costs nothing. Your brain is the largest user of energy in your body…\nGoogle\n\"\nIt is well established that the brain uses more energy than any other human organ, accounting for up to 20 percent of the body’s total haul.\n\"\nYour brain is 2% of your body weight, but uses 20% of your energy. This reality is echoed in actual computer infrastructure. Computers use energy, not only to run, but to build. Not only for hardware, but for software as well.\nIt takes a person to code software, and that person uses their brain that takes 20% of their bodies energy to run. These people can only create and implement a limited set of ideas within their lifetimes. To change the computer infrastructure underlying the world, it requires real energy, time, material and manpower, but most people think you can ‘just change it’.\nThink about this… If a human mind is like infrastructure, and it takes actual energy to change it, then there can come a point at which you simply cannot change a persons mind because the amount of energy and time to do so is effectively out of reach.\nMuch like physical infrastructure, computer infrastructure crumbles and requires repairs, gets built upon, has failures, needs to be rebuilt, informs future infrastructure in ways that are sub optimal, requires that the previous infrastructure be removed before new infrastructure can be put in its place. This does not NEED to be true, but it is often true because designing in such a way that software can easily be replaced requires a level of forethought that is simply impossible when first implementing an idea. BECAUSE it would be to computationally expensive (and thus, actually expensive, since computational infrastructure is real infrastructure) to invent it right now\nGames as a method of control Video games are in reality an interface for humans. They give humans a limited set of tools by which they can interact with a system, while giving the player enough motivation to continue playing the game. Historically, games have been a form of training for humans and animals. Dogs play fighting translates into real fighting when they eventually must defend themselves. These games create a hierarchy which has benefits, but in the long term the winner of the game can begin to bend the rules of the game for themselves.\nThis tends to end in conflict. Humans are able to feel empathy, but they are unable to truly understand one another. What seems like no big deal to one, could be putting another’s life at risk and all bets are off once someone must choose between death and death. It has been found that people will make choices against their own best interest if they feel they are getting a bad enough deal. In a simple game where users would split a pile of money, when people got less than 30% and were given the option to say no one gets money, they would often take that option, giving up the ability to gain money in order to screw the other person over. (this number would change based on the culture of the group, but the general idea is fairly consistent.)\nThis means that in order to keep people from screwing you over if you are screwing them over, you must change their ideology or reduce their belief that they are being screwed over. Humans do this naturally. The more recent term for it is gaslighting, though perhaps overused. One can do this by increasing the complexity of the problem and changing the language surrounding the problem. An example of this would be calling something deluxe and then making it more expensive, even if the word does not accurately describe the ‘upgrade’ one is receiving, but you can even go as far as to paint one sacrificing themselves as morally good, or painting money as being unimportant if you wish to take it from someone. In the case of hospitals, it is removing the ability for the player to see how the prices work in order to manipulate them without allowing the player enough information to stop it from happening.\nWe even play social games, and the rules of these games can disable us from fighting against the rules that are being forced onto us.\nExample: It is not culturally appropriate to say your actual view on a subject if that view is negative, especially if it deals with an individual. Stack this with the fact that you must appease everyone in the group and the group is everyone on the planet, This rule may as well read, you cannot speak. It is a natural conclusion as people don’t want to deal with their problems and they don’t want to be made to feel bad for their failings, but we must also find a way to communicate about and solve these problems somehow if we are to survive. These rules make it too simple for someone to manipulate the game in their favor by moving their wrong doing into territory that is socially unacceptable to challenge.\nThen, all that needs to be done, is to paint anything negative that would lead to a better understanding of the manipulation of the game, or to goals that may undermine the attempt to manipulate.\nRandom inputs do not create random outputs While a roll of the dice is random, the output of many rolls of the dice are not. Given enough rolls you will always end up with a normal distribution of outcomes. While peoples guesses on how many beans are in a jar are random within a range, if you ask enough people a distribution will reveal itself.There is an invisible magnet that pulls us towards certain outcomes, and that magnet seems to strengthen over time. Just as gravity exists, this statistical gravity also exists. This is why evolution has led to humans. Given our environment, it was a matter of time before something like us would exist. Maybe not exactly us, maybe even exactly us, we cannot know, but random inputs created a non random outcome and this happens all the time.\nThe Issue we face and a possible solution The game designer is also a player in the game, or more accurately, many players in the game. Humans, while very smart, have great difficulty being selfless on such a large scale. They simply lack the processing power and information channels to even know what being ‘good’ is. This has helped them survive in small tribes when destruction from using up all of the available resources and poisoning the entire planet was not a possibility, but now it will be the death of us if we are not able to construct a new interface that controls people in a way that reduces their ability and need to sacrifice others in their attempts to be greater than they perhaps ‘should be’.\nAs we become a larger entity, it is required that we have some glue that holds us together.\nA game is an interface to a world. A set of rules one must abide by with reward structures that channel these players towards a goal. RIght now, games are interfaces to imagined worlds. Ones we put on TV, football, soccer, video games etc. Right now, those goals are to extract money by mesmerizing people.\nBut that does not need to be what games are. It is because of games, music and movies that we have powerful video cards, high end photography equipment, recording equipment, advanced displays, etc. This is largely driven by the desire to have the game though, and not yet driven by the playing of the game itself, but there will come a time when we reach a flash point. A singularity where the game drives the players to advance the game itself through its manipulation of the players, or perhaps more accurately symbiosis with the players. In a technical sense this is already occurring, in a technical sense this was occurring before ‘video games’ existed. In the end evolution is always evolution. It is organized chaos. Randomness with minute changes that generate impossible conclusions.\nHow does this affect me? Knowing this should change your strategy for dealing with complex systems, how you structure your life. Kind of everything.\nThe biggest takeaway perhaps is that seemingly small things can have gigantic impacts. Not all inputs are equal, and not all failures are because you had the wrong idea, just as not all successes are because you had the right idea. When you know that everything is trying to control you, it becomes easier (though exhausting) to spot that control. The danger is not the things you catch, but the stuff that is being written into you that you don’t even realize. We all have to take inventory of our beliefs, challenge them, validate them. When we feed each other false information, we are losing. When we feed each other good information, our model becomes better, and we are better able to provide good information to each other in the future.\nThe affects of these ideas are far reaching and hard to contain in even this gigantic article. But hopefully interesting and useful as something to think about. This is my attempt to contain this whole thing into something ‘small’ so I can feel less of a need to talk about it.\n","wordCount":"2865","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"//magicbook.wiki/article-on-gamification/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Magic Book","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"//magicbook.wiki/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script>

As more &lsquo;games&rsquo; become computerized, and we stack further advances with this technique, they will do far better than us in almost all information gathering tasks. At some point the difference between human and computer will not exist. We will be the computer. This mathematical model essentially attempts to emulate existence, to brute force the answers to the question that is reality. This will be the &lsquo;game&rsquo; that people play, and it is not science fiction. It already exists, and you can see it at work right now, though a bit rudimentary.</p>

<p>It is no coincidence that religious groups get buddy buddy with news and politics. If you want to control people you change their ideas. This is why books are burned. This is why news is flooded with bullshit. Propaganda is all around us, everything you find in front of your face has a goal to make you feel or act a certain way. Disney got its start as war propaganda. Video games to make you put coins in the machine, and now to open loot boxes. You can only trust statistics. Sad truth, but the good news is that it means that truth is a solvable equation. Partially, the limit is that solving this equation takes actual energy and time as addressed later.</p>
<h3 id=computer-infrastructure-as-real-infrastructure>Computer infrastructure as real infrastructure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#computer-infrastructure-as-real-infrastructure>#</a></h3>
<p>One of the mistakes people make is believing that thought is an unlimited resource that costs nothing. Your brain is the largest user of energy in your body&mldr;</p>
<p>Google<br>
"<br>
It is well established that <strong>the brain uses more energy than any other human organ</strong>, accounting for up to 20 percent of the body&rsquo;s total haul.<br>
"</p>
<p>Your brain is 2% of your body weight, but uses 20% of your energy. This reality is echoed in actual computer infrastructure. Computers use energy, not only to run, but to build. Not only for hardware, but for software as well.</p>
<p>It takes a person to code software, and that person uses their brain that takes 20% of their bodies energy to run. These people can only create and implement a limited set of ideas within their lifetimes. To change the computer infrastructure underlying the world, it requires real energy, time, material and manpower, but most people think you can &lsquo;just change it&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Think about this&mldr; If a human mind is like infrastructure, and it takes actual energy to change it, then there can come a point at which you simply cannot change a persons mind because the amount of energy and time to do so is effectively out of reach.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Much like physical infrastructure, computer infrastructure crumbles and requires repairs</strong>, gets built upon, has failures, needs to be rebuilt, informs future infrastructure in ways that are sub optimal, requires that the previous infrastructure be removed before new infrastructure can be put in its place. This does not NEED to be true, but it is often true because designing in such a way that software can easily be replaced <strong>requires a level of forethought that is simply impossible when first implementing an idea. BECAUSE it would be to computationally expensive (and thus, actually expensive, since computational infrastructure is real infrastructure) to invent it right now</strong></p>
<h3 id=games-as-a-method-of-control>Games as a method of control<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#games-as-a-method-of-control>#</a></h3>
<p>Video games are in reality an interface for humans. They give humans a limited set of tools by which they can interact with a system, while giving the player enough motivation to continue playing the game. Historically, games have been a form of training for humans and animals. Dogs play fighting translates into real fighting when they eventually must defend themselves. These games create a hierarchy which has benefits, but in the long term the winner of the game can begin to bend the rules of the game for themselves.</p>
<p>This tends to end in conflict. Humans are able to feel empathy, but they are unable to truly understand one another. What seems like no big deal to one, could be putting another&rsquo;s life at risk and all bets are off once someone must choose between death and death. It has been found that people will make choices against their own best interest if they feel they are getting a bad enough deal. In a simple game where users would split a pile of money, when people got less than 30% and were given the option to say no one gets money, they would often take that option, giving up the ability to gain money in order to screw the other person over. (this number would change based on the culture of the group, but the general idea is fairly consistent.)</p>
<p>This means that in order to keep people from screwing you over if you are screwing them over, you must change their ideology or reduce their belief that they are being screwed over. Humans do this naturally. The more recent term for it is gaslighting, though perhaps overused. One can do this by increasing the complexity of the problem and changing the language surrounding the problem. An example of this would be calling something deluxe and then making it more expensive, even if the word does not accurately describe the &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; one is receiving, but you can even go as far as to paint one sacrificing themselves as morally good, or painting money as being unimportant if you wish to take it from someone. In the case of hospitals, it is removing the ability for the player to see how the prices work in order to manipulate them without allowing the player enough information to stop it from happening.</p>
<p>We even play social games, and the rules of these games can disable us from fighting against the rules that are being forced onto us.</p>
<p>Example: It is not culturally appropriate to say your actual view on a subject if that view is negative, especially if it deals with an individual. Stack this with the fact that you must appease everyone in the group and the group is everyone on the planet, <strong>This rule may as well read, you cannot speak.</strong> It is a natural conclusion as people don&rsquo;t want to deal with their problems and they don&rsquo;t want to be made to feel bad for their failings, but we must also find a way to communicate about and solve these problems somehow if we are to survive. <strong>These rules make it too simple for someone to manipulate the game in their favor by moving their wrong doing into territory that is socially unacceptable to challenge.</strong></p>
<p>Then, all that needs to be done, is to paint anything negative that would lead to a better understanding of the manipulation of the game, or to goals that may undermine the attempt to manipulate.</p>
<h3 id=random-inputs-do-not-create-random-outputs>Random inputs do not create random outputs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#random-inputs-do-not-create-random-outputs>#</a></h3>
<p>While a roll of the dice is random, the output of many rolls of the dice are not. Given enough rolls you will always end up with a normal distribution of outcomes. While peoples guesses on how many beans are in a jar are random within a range, if you ask enough people a distribution will reveal itself.There is an invisible magnet that pulls us towards certain outcomes, and that magnet seems to strengthen over time. Just as gravity exists, this statistical gravity also exists. This is why evolution has led to humans. Given our environment, it was a matter of time before something like us would exist. Maybe not exactly us, maybe even exactly us, we cannot know, but random inputs created a non random outcome and this happens all the time.</p>
<h3 id=the-issue-we-face-and-a-possible-solution>The Issue we face and a possible solution<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-issue-we-face-and-a-possible-solution>#</a></h3>
<p>The game designer is also a player in the game, or more accurately, many players in the game. Humans, while very smart, have great difficulty being selfless on such a large scale. <strong>They simply lack the processing power and information channels to even know what being &lsquo;good&rsquo; is.</strong> This has helped them survive in small tribes when destruction from using up all of the available resources and poisoning the entire planet was not a possibility, but now it will be the death of us if we are not able to construct a new interface that controls people in a way that reduces their ability and need to sacrifice others in their attempts to be greater than they perhaps &lsquo;should be&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>As we become a larger entity, it is required that we have some glue that holds us together.</strong></p>
<p>A game is an interface to a world. A set of rules one must abide by with reward structures that channel these players towards a goal. RIght now, games are interfaces to imagined worlds. Ones we put on TV, football, soccer, video games etc. Right now, those goals are to extract money by mesmerizing people.</p>
<p>But that does not need to be what games are. It is because of games, music and movies that we have powerful video cards, high end photography equipment, recording equipment, advanced displays, etc. This is largely driven by the desire to have the game though, and not yet driven by the playing of the game itself, but there will come a time when we reach a flash point. A <strong>singularity</strong> where the game drives the players to advance the game itself through its manipulation of the players, or perhaps more accurately <strong>symbiosis</strong> with the players. In a technical sense this is already occurring, in a technical sense this was occurring before &lsquo;video games&rsquo; existed. In the end evolution is always evolution. It is organized chaos. Randomness with minute changes that generate impossible conclusions.</p>
<h3 id=how-does-this-affect-me>How does this affect me?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-does-this-affect-me>#</a></h3>
<p>Knowing this should change your strategy for dealing with complex systems, how you structure your life. Kind of everything.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaway perhaps is that seemingly small things can have gigantic impacts. Not all inputs are equal, and not all failures are because you had the wrong idea, just as not all successes are because you had the right idea. When you know that everything is trying to control you, it becomes easier (though exhausting) to spot that control. The danger is not the things you catch, but the stuff that is being written into you that you don&rsquo;t even realize. We all have to take inventory of our beliefs, challenge them, validate them. When we feed each other false information, we are losing. When we feed each other good information, our model becomes better, and we are better able to provide good information to each other in the future.</p>
<p>The affects of these ideas are far reaching and hard to contain in even this gigantic article. But hopefully interesting and useful as something to think about. This is my attempt to contain this whole thing into something &lsquo;small&rsquo; so I can feel less of a need to talk about it.</p>
