The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.Credit…Eve Edelheit for The New York Times\nBy Derrick Bryson Taylor\nMarch 17, 2021\n阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版\nThe coronavirus, which surfaced in a Chinese seafood and poultry market in December 2019, has spread to nearly every country, upending life and derailing the global economy. The virus has killed more than 1.6 million and sickened more than 76 million over the last year. The World Health Organization has declared the situation a global pandemic.\nSeveral world leaders, including President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, contracted the virus during the uphill battle to mitigate its spread within their borders, proving even the most powerful could fall to the virus’ grip.\nIn early December 2020, nations began the race to secure vaccines and a few Western countries began administering shots to its most vulnerable populations, in an effort to bring the virus under control.\nHere’s a timeline of the outbreak over the past year.\nDEC. 31\nChinese authorities treated dozens of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause. On Dec. 31, the government in Wuhan, China, confirmed that health authorities were treating dozens of cases. Days later, researchers in China identified a new virus that had infected dozens of people in Asia. At the time, there was no evidence that the virus was readily spread by humans. Health officials in China said they were monitoring it to prevent the outbreak from developing into something more severe.\nADVERTISEMENT\nContinue reading the main story\nJAN. 11\nChina reported its first death. On Jan. 11, Chinese state media reported the first known death from an illness caused by the virus, which had infected dozens of people. The 61-year-old man who died was a regular customer at the market in Wuhan. The report of his death came just before one of China’s biggest holidays, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country.\nJAN. 20\nOther countries, including the United States, confirmed cases. The first confirmed cases outside mainland China occurred in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, according to the W.H.O.’s first situation report. The first confirmed case in the United States came the next day in Washington State, where a man in his 30s developed symptoms after returning from a trip to Wuhan.\nJAN. 23\nWuhan, a city of more than 11 million, was cut off by the Chinese authorities.

At this point, at least 17 people had died and more than 570 others had been infected, including in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States.\nJAN. 30\nThe W.H.O. declared a global health emergency. Amid thousands of new cases in China, a “public health emergency of international concern” was officially declared by the W.H.O. China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that it would continue to work with the W.H.O. and other countries to protect public health, and the U.S. State Department warned travelers to avoid China.\nADVERTISEMENT\nContinue reading the main story\nJAN. 31\nThe Trump administration restricted travel from China The Trump administration suspended entry into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the past 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents.

The W.H.O. proposed an official name for the disease the virus causes: Covid-19, an acronym that stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The name makes no reference to any of the people, places, or animals associated with the coronavirus, given the goal to avoid stigma.\nADVERTISEMENT\nContinue reading the main story\nFEB. 14\nFrance announced the first coronavirus death in Europe.

While the number of reported cases in India was about 500, the prime minister pledged to spend about $2 billion on medical supplies, isolation rooms, ventilators and training for medical professionals.\nMARCH 26\nThe United States led the world in confirmed cases. The United States officially became the country hardest hit by the pandemic, with at least 81,321 confirmed infections and more than 1,000 deaths. This was more reported cases than in China, Italy or any other country at the time.\nAPRIL 2\nCases topped a million, and millions lost their jobs. By April 2, the pandemic had sickened more than one million people in 171 countries across six continents, killing at least 51,000.\nIn just a few weeks, the pandemic put nearly 10 million Americans out of work, including a staggering 6.6 million people who applied for unemployment benefits in the last week of March. The speed and scale of the job losses was without precedent: Until March, the worst week for unemployment filings was 695,000 in 1982.\nAPRIL 6\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson moved into intensive care. Ten days after going public with his coronavirus diagnosis, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain was moved into intensive care. The decision was a precaution, according to the British government, who also said he had been in good spirits. Mr. Johnson had also asked the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to deputize for him “where necessary.” He was released on April 12.\nAPRIL 10\nCases surged in Russia.

Officials in Santa Clara County, Calif., announced that two residents there died of the coronavirus on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17, making them the earliest known victims of the pandemic in the United States. The new information, gained from autopsies of the residents, moved the timeline of the virus’s spread in country weeks earlier than previously understood. .\nAPRIL 24\nThe European Union, pressured by China, watered down a report on disinformation. The E.U. appeared to succumb to pressure from Beijing and softened criticism of China in a report on disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. While the initial report was not particularly harsh, European officials delayed and then rewrote the document to dilute the focus on China, a vital trading partner.\nAPRIL 26\nThe global death toll surpassed 200,000.

If the diagnosis is verified, it would suggest that the virus appeared in Europe nearly a month earlier than previously understood and days before Chinese authorities first reported the new illness to the World Health Organization. The first report of an infection in Europe was on Jan. 24 in France.\nThe Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest Updates Updated\nFeb. 14, 2022, 8:10 p.m. ET2 hours ago\n2 hours ago\n California’s mask requirement in schools continues, even as other mandates ease.

Peru and Chile ranked among the hardest-hit countries in the world in terms of infections per capita, around 1 in 300. Data from Ecuador indicated that it was suffering one of the worst outbreaks in the world. The United States remained the global epicenter, with more than 1.6 million cases and the number of deaths nearing 100,000.\nMAY 27\nCoronavirus deaths in the U.S. passed 100,000. Four months after the government confirmed the first known case, more than 100,000 people who had the coronavirus were recorded dead in the United States. The death toll was far higher than in any other nation around the world.\nADVERTISEMENT\nContinue reading the main story\nJUNE 4\nCoronavirus tore into regions previously spared. The number of known cases across the globe grew faster than ever, with more than 100,000 new infections a day. Densely populated, low- and middle-income countries across the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and South Asia were hit the hardest, suggesting bad news for strongmen and populists who once reaped political points by vaunting low infection rates as evidence of their leadership’s virtues.\nJUNE 11\nCoronavirus cases in Africa topped 200,000. The W.H.O. said that it took Africa 98 days to reach 100,000 coronavirus cases, but only 18 days for that figure to double. While the sharp rise in cases could be explained by an increase in testing, the agency said, more than half of the 54 countries on the continent were experiencing community transmissions. Ten countries were driving the rise in numbers and accounted for nearly 80 percent of all cases. South Africa has a quarter of the total cases.\nJUNE 20\nSouthern U.S. states saw sharp rise in cases. Image\nSouthern states see a considerable uptick in new infections.Credit…Cristobal Herrera/EPA, via Shutterstock\nOn June 20, for the third straight day, Florida and South Carolina broke their single-day records for new cases.

On June 19, the United States reported more than 30,000 new infections, its highest since May 1, with cases rising in 19 states across the South, West and Midwest.\nJUNE 30\nThe E.U. said it would reopen borders. The European Union prepared to open to visitors from 15 countries on July 1, but not to travelers from the United States, Brazil or Russia. The move puts into effect a complex policy that seeks to balance health concerns with politics, diplomacy and the desperate need for tourism revenue. Australia, Canada and New Zealand were among the approved list of countries. Travelers from China will be permitted if China reciprocates.\nJULY 1\nIran announced new lockdown measures.

Eight provinces, including Tehran, the capital, were among the areas considered red zones. The partial shutdown in Tehran restricted movement, cut work hours and banned large gatherings like weddings and funerals.\nADVERTISEMENT\nContinue reading the main story\nJULY 7\nBrazil’s president tested positive. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil disclosed on July 7 that he had been infected with the virus, saying that he was tested after experiencing fatigue, muscle pain and a fever.

The infection rate was underscored by alarming growth in the South and West. At least six states had also reported single-day records for new cases: Georgia, Utah, Montana, North Carolina, Iowa and Ohio.\nJULY 10\nHong Kong shut down schools amid a third wave. Hong Kong, a city of seven million, has reported more than 1,400 cases and seven deaths. But on July 10, it shut down its school system as it worked to contain a third wave of infections, which official reports included 38 new cases.\nThe third wave, which comes after infections surged in March and were contained by May, was a setback for a city that had largely returned to normal, with restaurants enjoying packed crowds and workers returning to offices.\nJULY 13\nMore than five million Americans lost health insurance. The coronavirus pandemic stripped an estimated 5.4 million Americans of their health insurance between February and May, a period in which more adults became uninsured because of job losses than have ever lost coverage in a single year, according to a study.\nJULY 15\nTokyo raised its pandemic alert level.

In the week before, Tokyo recorded two consecutive daily records with a peak of 243 cases on July 10. Since February, the sprawling metropolis of 14 million had reported a total of just under 8,200 cases and 325 deaths.\nJULY 16\nA study in South Korea found that older children spread the virus comparably to adults. While school districts around the United States struggle with reopening plans, a study from South Korea offered a note of caution. It found that children between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do, suggesting that middle and high schools in particular may seed new clusters of infection. Children younger than 10 transmit to others much less often, according to the study, although the risk is not zero.\nThe Coronavirus Pandemic: Key Things to Know  Card 1 of 4\nCovid restrictions easing. Officials in​​ Washington, D.C., and Maryland joined a growing list of leaders to announce the loosening of pandemic rules as the Omicron wave recedes in the U.S. The moves come after President Biden said that ending mask mandates is “probably premature.”\nN.Y.C.’s vaccine mandate. New York City fired about 1,430 workers for failing to comply with its vaccine mandate. The figure represents less than 1 percent of the city’s work force, but it is likely the nation’s largest mass termination of municipal employees in response to such a mandate.\nAround the world. Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, has tested positive for Covid, which is likely to fan further concerns about the health of Queen Elizabeth II. In Canada, Ontario is ending its so-called vaccine pass, a change the premier said was not a concession to the trucker-led protesters.\nA spike in pedestrian deaths. Two years into the pandemic, pedestrian fatalities are soaring amid a nationwide flare-up in reckless driving.

<p>The coronavirus, which surfaced in a Chinese seafood and poultry market in December 2019, has spread to nearly every country, upending life and derailing the global economy. The virus has killed more than 1.6 million and sickened more than 76 million over the last year. The <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-world-health-organization.html>World Health Organization</a> has declared the situation a global <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/health/coronavirus-pandemic-lessons.html>pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>Several world leaders, including President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, contracted the virus during the uphill battle to mitigate its spread within their borders, proving even the most powerful could fall to the virus’ grip.</p>
<p>In early December 2020, nations began the race to secure vaccines and a few Western countries began administering shots to its most vulnerable populations, in an effort to bring the virus under control.</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline of the outbreak over the past year.</p>

Days later, researchers in China <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html>identified a new virus</a> that had infected dozens of people in Asia. At the time, there was no evidence that the virus was readily spread by humans. Health officials in China said they were monitoring it to prevent the outbreak from developing into something more severe.</p>

Children younger than 10 transmit to others much less often, according to the study, although the risk is not zero.</p>
