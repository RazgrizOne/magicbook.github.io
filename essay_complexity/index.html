<p>This time is different</p>
<p>an adage we often hear. The world has changed for people in the past, so what makes this time different? Peoples lives rocked by any number of causes. Losing wars, winning wars, financial collapse, natural disasters, ques, hostile business takeovers, uegentics. How is this time any different? Are we really moving towards a future where anything is possible, or is our future collapsing in on itself?</p>
<p>Part 1 : Everything is a nail</p>
<p>One would imagine that information, experience, and tools liberate the wielder, but I would argue that these things are barriers as much as they are building blocks. Knowledge and tools can become a cage; You know this problem is too hard to solve. You know you don&rsquo;t have the right tool for this job. You know the right way to solve this problem is with this tool. Often a fresh set of eyes and new set of tools can cut straight through a problem once thought to be impossible. Your mind and tools solidify into a highway that you cannot leave, then a train station. You have a hammer, and every problem looks like a nail.</p>
<p>Some of the best work I ever did as a programmer was some of the earliest work I did. Untethered by the best practices and the weight of what is realistically possible. I took swings far outside of my ability, and although the output was bad, the vision was there.</p>
<p>Part 1 : Consolodation and Dispersion</p>
<p>Some of the best work I ever did as a programmer was done in my first few months of being one. One could look at this as a acknowledgement of my lack of programming ability, and I would not argue with them, but I also think we must acknowledge the explosion of complexity in the programming space. Sometimes, simple building blocks can create masterpieces. As you gain knowledge or more and &lsquo;better&rsquo; tools. It begins to take more mental processing to come to a solid conclusion. You get stuck in an evaluation state, rather than a state of doing. Like trying to clean a room while someone is constantly running around knocking over the neat and tidy piles you have made. Like trying to read a text book while the language keeps changing. French to english to spanish to some language you have never even heard of.</p>
<p>There is a name for it in the programming space. Tutorial Hell. Where you jump from one</p>
<p>Not only the programming space, but life in general. It is not enough to be physically distant from those who may threaten you. You now must have a secure operating system, bank. Two factor authentication, A main job, a second job in case that job fails, internet, a phone, not just any phone a cell phone, not just any cell phone a smart phone. You need to be an investor. You need to be a writer to communicate through emails and text messages. A master of at least one interesting thing. An instrument, a musical talent, an ability to speak. You must have taste in clothing. Knowledge of</p>
