        <p>I could write a million different books on every subject. I could write a giant book on math and science. Perhaps one on statistics (though I probably will write something on statistics). I could dig deep and learn hardware in order to bring you an expert education on building computers from scratch. This all seems like the wrong approach though.

<p>What I hope to do instead is to give you tools with very broad use cases. It may not be clear now as to why this is, but hopefully as you read the reasons become clear. There is a method to my madness and you are going to have to trust me and come along for the ride to some extent.</p>
<p>Below are the different subjects for this chapter. You are free to tackle them in any order, and you do not need to complete all of them to move on. Each page will contain a clue as to how to get the next chapter and you only need some of the clues to move on. I ask that you make an honest effort to complete the chapters you do read, and I ask that you do not attempt to digest everything in a linear fashion. Make your choices. You can always come back later if you wish.</p>
<p>If you are somewhat of a wizard yourself, I asked that you first make an honest attempt to experience this without &lsquo;cheating&rsquo;. The act of breaking the <a href="//magicbook.wiki/puzzle-box/">puzzle box</a> tends to kill the fun. Enjoy it a little bit.</p>
<p>Oh and perhaps I should let you know now. There is a reward at the end of this tunnel. Good luck!</p>
