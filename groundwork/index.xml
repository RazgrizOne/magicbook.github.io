      <description>GalliumOS Unscrew safety screw, load new firmware, install gallium Have to find the guide again and go through it from square one.
 This does not use the same technique as I did, but it seems to work. He does not note the screw inside of the device, so perhaps I will need to find a video that goes over that.</description>

      <description>*GalliumOS *uses xfce4 which is a Linux desktop environment.
xfce4 uses something called xfce screenshooter which is the built in screenshot application. (it may actually be seperate but it comes with GalliumOS)
You can go to keyboard settings in GalliumOS and change the command that is run to screenshot a selection instead of the entire screen.
In my case I used the command xfce4-screenshooter -c -r</description>

      <description>Need to find a website that can be generated by markdown documents like obsidian and can do links like obsidian. I found something before, but I will need to dig around and try to find it again.
I want a very fast way to generate webpages without having to try too hard. If I can generate traffic, perhaps I will be able to do something with that traffic.
