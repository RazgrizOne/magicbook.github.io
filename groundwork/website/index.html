<p>Shameless plug: <a href="https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export/">obsidian-export</a>. It will convert <code>[[WikiLinks]]</code> and <code>![[Embeds]]</code> to plain Markdown (among a few other things) so you&rsquo;ll always have a way to go back if Obsidian doesn&rsquo;t work out the way you hoped.</p>
<p>I originally wrote it for exactly this reason, though I also now use it to author all of my site content directly in Obsidian and publish to <a href="https://nick.groenen.me/">https://nick.groenen.me/</a> with</p>
<p><code>$</code> <code>chmod</code> <code>+x file_name.bin</code>
$ sudo ./file_name.bin</p>
<p>Oh that is because when you run that application it expects a path of the input and a path to the output. I will need to write a helper script that just runs from path a to path b with that script.</p>
<p>$ ./op-ex.bin ./from ./to_file</p>
<p>Alright, now I have my input for <a href="//magicbook.wiki/groundwork/hugo/">Hugo</a></p>
