<p>It is great to have you here at the gates of my personal <em>journal</em>. A book that if burned, can be regenerated an infinite number of times with pages that can be viewed from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;magic book&rsquo; you might say.</p>

I assure you that it would have seemed like magic to the poor scribes of ancient china in 868 AD. They had just invented a technique for printing books which required they hand carve mirrored text into a wood block. Imagine if you came along with right-click, copy, paste, and a printer.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, we are not in need of mysticism to fill in for a lack of magic in the universe. You may not like the flavor of magic we have, but I have often found that a dislike of something stems from a lack of mastery. When you look up into the night sky you are looking back in time, billions of years to the start of time itself. You are an intelligence created by the banging of rocks for an incomprehensible amount of time. You stand, or sit, or walk carelessly into roads made for iron chariots while looking down at your interstellar communication device reading a message from a intelligent being on the other side of the world reaching out to you with a message.</p>
<p>The world is full of magic and danger. It is only through hard work, honesty with ourselves, and a level of cooperation and trust we have never seen before that we will exit this age of banality and find ourselves in an age of magic and wonder. We will likely not live to see it through, but if we have any hope of it ever existing, we must come together and make it so.</p>
