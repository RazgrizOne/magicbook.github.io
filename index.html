    <p>Hello! Come in! Come in!</p>
<p>It is great to have you here at the gates of my <em>personal journal</em>. With pages that cannot be burned and words viewable from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;magic book&rsquo; you might say.</p>
<p>Now that might sound grandiose. &ldquo;Magic!? This is technology. Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;
I assure you that this would be indiscernible magic to the scribes of ancient china nearly 3000 years ago. Their technique for printing books required they hand carve mirrored text into wooden blocks. One for every page. Now reflect a moment on the power of &lsquo;copy&rsquo;, and &lsquo;paste&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, we are not in need of mysticism to fill in for a lack of whimsy in the universe. When you look up into the night sky you are looking back in time, billions of years to the start of time itself. This is not a metaphor. You are an intelligent being created by the banging of rocks for an incomprehensibly large amount of time. You ride in an iron chariot that harnesses the power of a million tiny explosions while reading your interstellar communication device. A second being reaches out to you from the other side of the world with a message. Will you receive it?</p>
<p>The world is full of magic and danger, so we must always stay vigilant. We are tired creatures who drift off into dreams. Each dream brings us further from the reality that is our salvation and closer to danger. We must shake each other awake for this age of banality to give way to one of magic and wonder. We may not live to see it through, but if we have any hope of the dream becoming reality, we must come together and make it so.</p>
<p>When you are ready, please open up to the <a href="//magicbook.wiki/first-chapter/">first chapter</a> of this <a href="//magicbook.wiki/magic-book/">Magic Book</a>! May the lessons I learned the hard way empower you to create a better world long after I am dead and gone.</p>
<p>Sincerely
Andrew Adkins</p>
<p>Year 2022, January 31st</p>
