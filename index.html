    <p>Hello! Come in! Come in!</p>
<p>It is great to have you here at the gates of my <em>personal journal</em>. With pages that cannot be burned and words viewable from anywhere in the world, and perhaps one day, beyond.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;magic book&rsquo; you might say.</p>
<p>Now that might sound grandiose. &ldquo;Magic!? This is technology. Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;
I assure you that it would have seemed like magic to the scribes of ancient china in 868 AD. Their technique for printing books required they hand carve mirrored text into wooden blocks. One for every page. Now reflect a moment on the power that &lsquo;copy&rsquo;, and &lsquo;paste&rsquo; hold.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, we are not in need of mysticism to fill in for a lack of whimsy in the universe. You may not like the flavor of magic we have, but I have often found that a dislike of something stems from a lack of mastery. When you look up into the night sky you are looking back in time, billions of years to the start of time itself. This is not a metaphor. You are an intelligent being created by the banging of rocks for an incomprehensibly large amount of time. You ride in an iron chariot that harnesses the power of a million tiny explosions while reading your interstellar communication device. A second being reaches out to you from the other side of the world with a message. Will you receive it?</p>
<p>The world is full of magic and danger. It is only through hard work, dedication, honesty with ourselves, and a level of cooperation and trust few have mustered, that this age of banality will give way to one of magic and wonder. We may not live to see it through, but if we have any hope of it ever existing, we must come together and make it so.</p>
<p>When you are ready, please enter the the humble door to my <a href="//magicbook.wiki/magic-book/">Magic Book</a>! May the lessons I learned the hard way empower you to create a better world long after I am dead and gone.</p>
