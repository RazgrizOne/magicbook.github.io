      <description>Above, you can see the folder, Title, Author and Date. Below you can see both a pasted image, and a youtube video. I am able to have my notes translated to something that is comaptible with Hugo.
 This does not use the same technique as I did, but it seems to work. He does not note the screw inside of the device, so perhaps I will need to find a video that goes over that.</description>

      <description>I am unable to move.
The future promised more&amp;hellip; More knowledge, more tools, more freedom of expression, more possibilities. The truth is though, as time has moved forward I have only felt the possibility shrinking. Our collective future compressing into a single point that is the future. Perhaps this is always how aging feels. A feeling of fewer possbilities from a horizon that is much closer than you thought it was at first glance, but I am not so certain that this feeling comes from the same aging people before us experienced.</description>

      <description>*GalliumOS *uses xfce4 which is a Linux desktop environment.
xfce4 uses something called xfce screenshooter which is the built in screenshot application. (it may actually be seperate but it comes with GalliumOS)
You can go to keyboard settings in GalliumOS and change the command that is run to screenshot a selection instead of the entire screen.
In my case I used the command xfce4-screenshooter -c -r</description>

      <description>Need to find a website that can be generated by markdown documents like obsidian and can do links like obsidian. I found something before, but I will need to dig around and try to find it again.
I want a very fast way to generate webpages without having to try too hard. If I can generate traffic, perhaps I will be able to do something with that traffic.

      <description>These are the things I am currently trying to work on. I should try to stay somewhat focused. I watched an interesting video by Bobby Brocolli that went over how to make videos using google earth like another yotuber who uses it for sports videos.
-I should use the database features to create a page that stores all the current goals I have.

      <description>for creating linux isos
could boot up your own computer from a flash drive
https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/index.html this looks like it will be very useful. Page 57 so far, but I will have to go back and read a lot for sure and take notes. Perhaps I should download it on to my tablet and draw on it.</description>

      <description>obsidian-export This tool is used to convert obsidian notes into a structure that can be used by Hugo.
//I should write out instructions on how to use it here
I was able to convert my notes into something that can be used by hugo, but images did not work. the link used has two dots. If I change it to one dot does it work?
I also need to create front matter in my pages so things like title and author show.</description>
