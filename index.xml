These are the things I am currently trying to work on. I should try to stay somewhat focused. I watched an interesting video by Bobby Brocolli that went over how to make videos using google earth like another yotuber who uses it for sports videos.
-I should use the database features to create a page that stores all the current goals I have.

      <description>I am unable to move.
The future promised more&amp;hellip; More knowledge, more tools, more freedom of expression, more possibilities. The truth is though, as time has moved forward I have only felt the possibility shrinking. Our collective future compressing into a single point that is the future. Perhaps this is always how aging feels. A feeling of fewer possbilities from a horizon that is much closer than you thought it was at first glance, but I am not so certain that this feeling comes from the same aging people before us experienced.</description>

      <description>*GalliumOS *uses xfce4 which is a Linux desktop environment.
xfce4 uses something called xfce screenshooter which is the built in screenshot application. (it may actually be seperate but it comes with GalliumOS)
You can go to keyboard settings in GalliumOS and change the command that is run to screenshot a selection instead of the entire screen.
In my case I used the command xfce4-screenshooter -c -r</description>

      <description>Relative links with Hugo The Hugo static site generator does not support relative links to files. Instead, it expects you to link to other pages using the [ref and relref shortcodes].
As a result of this, notes that have been exported from Obsidian using obsidian-export do not work out of the box because Hugo doesn&amp;rsquo;t resolve these links correctly.
Markdown Render Hooks (only supported using the default goldmark renderer) allow you to work around this issue however, making exported notes work with Hugo after a bit of one-time setup work.</description>

      <description>obsidian-export This tool is used to convert obsidian notes into a structure that can be used by Hugo.
//I should write out instructions on how to use it here
I was able to convert my notes into something that can be used by hugo, but images did not work. the link used has two dots. If I change it to one dot does it work?
I also need to create front matter in my pages so things like title and author show.</description>

      <description>Rotations I have spent most of my life trying to curate something I will call a rotation. This concept comes from the games I played as a child. In these games you were wizards and warriors, rogues and witch doctors, Knights and Healers. Each one of these had a set of tools that was good for handling different situations. They complimented and countered each other.
As you played the game, you would collect different spells, attacks, and support skills.</description>

      <description>I could write a million different books on every subject. I could write a giant book on math and science. Perhaps one on statistics (though I probably will write something on statistics). I could dig deep and learn hardware in order to bring you an expert education on building computers from scratch. This all seems like the wrong approach though. There are people out there who do this better than I, and perhaps more than anything the best thing I can do is point you in their direction, but I think I can do one better than that.</description>

      <description>Need to find a website that can be generated by markdown documents like obsidian and can do links like obsidian. I found something before, but I will need to dig around and try to find it again.
I want a very fast way to generate webpages without having to try too hard. If I can generate traffic, perhaps I will be able to do something with that traffic.
