<p>This tool is used to convert obsidian notes into a structure that can be used by <a href="/groundwork/hugo/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>//I should write out instructions on how to use it here</p>
<p>I was able to convert my notes into something that can be used by hugo, but images did not work. the link used has two dots. If I change it to one dot does it work?</p>
<p>I also need to create front matter in my pages so things like title and author show. I will have to look that up in a minute&hellip;</p>
<p>Probably also a good idea to make the target folder the normal folder that I use for my notes and the target folder the one used for the website so I don&rsquo;t have to do any manual moving.</p>
<p>-test if images work when he link is correct.
-set up front matter and make sure that is working.
-write a guide to converting the notes.
-set source folder to working obsidian vault
-set target folder to website folder
-create a one click script for converting</p>
